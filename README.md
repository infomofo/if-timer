# IF Timer

This app will be a basic hour countdown timer.

It will have two states:
- If a timer is not currently set, the user will be prompted to enter a number of hours, and hit start
- If a timer is set, the user will be shown the number of hours, minutes, and seconds until the timer goes off, they
  will also be given a button that lets them stop the current timer which returns it to the other state.

## TODO

Remaining todo

- Make number of hours configurable- this should be a step function that the user can enter on the watch or the phone
- Make the phone and watch sync on major events
- Send a notification when the timer ends
- Allow the watch to resume state and go to sleep when you're not using it, without losing time
